Contribution Guides
--------------------------------------

In the spirit of open source software development, jQuery always encourages community code contribution. To help you get started and before you jump into writing code, be sure to read these important contribution guidelines thoroughly:

1. [Getting Involved](https://contribute.jquery.org/)
2. [Core Style Guide](https://contribute.jquery.org/style-guide/js/)
3. [Writing Code for jQuery Foundation Projects](https://contribute.jquery.org/code/)

### References to issues/PRs

GitHub issues/PRs are usually referenced via `gh-NUMBER`, where `NUMBER` is the numerical ID of the issue/PR. You can find such an issue/PR under `https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/NUMBER`.

jQuery has used a different bug tracker - based on Trac - in the past, available under [bugs.jquery.com](https://bugs.jquery.com/). It is being kept in read only mode so that referring to past discussions is possible. When jQuery source references one of those issues, it uses the pattern `trac-NUMBER`, where `NUMBER` is the numerical ID of the issue. You can find such an issue under `https://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/NUMBER`.


Environments in which to use jQuery
